1) have the node js server render views/index.ejs that has the html  contentfor the client whenever the client requests "/".

	routings/index.js

	app.get("/", function(req,res){
		res.render('index,{}');
	})

2) In the client codes, have a javascript code that asks the user for thier names and store this user input in a variable called name.

	<script>
		var name = prompt('What is your name?');
	</script>

3) have the client EMIT "got_a_new_user" and pass "name" to the server.

	<script>
		var name = prompt('What is your name?');
		io = io.connect();
		io.emit('got_a_new_user', {name: name})
	</script>

4) have the server LISTEN for an event called 'got_a_new_user' and when that event gets triggered, 
4.1) have the server BROADCAST AN EVENT called "new_user" to the client with the name of the new user attached to this event, 

	app.io.route('got_a_new_user', function(req){
		app.io.broadcast('new_user', {new_user_name: req.data.name})
	});

4.2) we store the name/sessionID of thr new user in a variable/array/hash called users 

	var users = {};
	users[]

4.3) to the person who sent this reqeuest we EMIT an event called 'existing_users' with all the users data.

	app.io.route('got_a_new_user', function(req){

		app.io.broadcast('new_user', {new_user_name: req.data.name});

		req.io.emit('existing_users', users);
	});

5) Have the client listen for an event called 'new_user' and when this event gets triggered, have the client render this information in jQuery somewhere in the HTML.

	<script>
		var name = prompt('What is your name?');
		io = io.connect();
		io.emit('got_a_new_user', {name: name})

		io.on('new_user', function(data){
			//render this info in HTML
		});
	</script>

6) Have the server listen for an event called 'disconnect' andf when this occurs, BROADCAST to all clients an event 'disconnect_user' with some data (Name of the disconnected user)(NOTE: we'll probably need to pass sessionID or something to identify user)

	

7) Have the client listen for an event 'disconnect_user' and when this gets triggered, have the client remove the proper jQuery box.
